# Statistics-for-Bioengineering-Sciences

### A repository from engineers to engineers for Statistics and Probability Theory 

Every engineer and scientist should have in their toolbox a course module on Statistics and Probability theory. There is extensive literature with well-written information and theory. However, a condensed library that combines the concepts of statistics and probability with a Python-focused implementation is not clearly available. We provide all the Python applications required for Statistics and Probability in this repository.
